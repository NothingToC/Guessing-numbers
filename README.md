# Guessing-numbers
This program is a small console game in which the computer makes a random number from 1 to 10 inclusive. 
If you guess, then you are awarded 1 point, 
if you did not guess, then nothing is awarded to you. 
A feature of this console game is the ability to choose a language. 
This is my first mini project :)
